    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Butternut Squash Soup is the perfect fall dish. From its taste to color and warmth, it encompasses all things autumn. Served pipping hot with a hunk of crusty bread, this creamy, nourishing recipe is fall comfort food at its best.</p>
      <p>On a brisk day, there’s nothing more soothing than chopping and simmering vegetables over a warm stove. As you cook, the kitchen fills with the cozy scent of sage, rosemary, and butternut squash, and when you’re finished, steaming bowls of butternut squash soup (that will last all week!) reward you for your work.</p>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Sauté the onion, carrot, and celery in butter:
Heat a large thick-bottomed pot on medium-high heat. Melt the butter in the pot and let it foam up and recede. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and sauté for 5 minutes. Lower the heat if the vegetables begin to brown.</li>
	<li>Cook the soup:
Add the butternut squash, apple, broth, and water. Bring to boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or so, until the squash and carrots have softened.</li>
	<li>Purée the soup:
Use an immersion blender to purée the soup, or work in batches and purée the soup in a stand blender.</li>
	<li>Add the seasonings:
Add pinches of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cayenne. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives and, if you want, a dollop of sour cream.</li>
